                    <h3>How can I book an appointment?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Booking an appointment is best done over the phone at

                        We do require a credit card or a gift card number on file to book an appointment. 
                        This card will NOT be charged; it is only used to enforce our cancellation policy (see below).

                    <h3>What if I have to cancel?</h3>
                    <p>
                        For Single or Double appointments, there will be no charge for cancellations made more than 48 hours before your scheduled appointment time. For cancellations made within 48 hours of appointment time, we ask for 50% of the scheduled service(s) price. In the event of a cancellation within 1 hour of your appointment or a no-show, 100% of your service(s) will be charged.<br><br>                       
                        We would love to host your group for your next party or special event! For bookings of 3 or more, we require a 7-day notice for cancellation. If we receive a cancellation less than 7 days before the appointment time, 50% of the service(s) will be charged. In the event of a cancellation within 24 hours, 100% of the service(s) will be charged.<br><br>                       
                        We are sympathetic and understand things come up in life, but we cannot absorb the financial responsibility of cancellations. When you forget your appointment or cancel without giving enough notice, we don’t have the opportunity to fill that appointment time, and we are still responsible for paying the therapist you were scheduled with. Thanks for understanding.
