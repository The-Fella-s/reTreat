                  Booking an appointment is best done over the phone at{' '}
                  <a href="tel:+19169182969">(916) 918-2969</a> or by clicking the 'book appointment' tab above.
                  We can also be reached through the email chat function on our website, by emailing{' '}
                  <a href="mailto:retreatroseville@gmail.com">retreatroseville@gmail.com</a>, or through Facebook Messenger.
                  Our front desk staff will reach out to you at our earliest convenience to book your appointment. We do require a credit card or a gift card number on file to book an appointment.
                  This card will NOT be charged; it is only used to enforce our cancellation policy (see below).

            to get to know your medical history, injuries, or concerns you may have. If you are late for your scheduled appointment,
            we will do our best to accommodate your full booking. If we are unable to do so, your appointment will end on time and the full 
            amount of service will apply.`
