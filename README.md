## Tech Stack
**Frontend**
- [React](https://reactjs.org): React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of those components in a clear and efficient manner.
- [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/): Vite is a fast build tool and development server that significantly improves the development experience. It supports fast hot module replacement (HMR), meaning updates to your code reflect instantly in the browser without needing to reload the whole page.
- [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/): Material UI is a popular React component library that implements Googleâ€™s Material Design guidelines. It provides pre-built components like buttons, forms, modals, and more, along with styling solutions, to help speed up UI development.

**Backend:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en): A runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and efficient. It's commonly used for building scalable and performant web applications, APIs, and real-time applications. It has a large ecosystem of libraries via npm (Node Package Manager).

**APIs**
- Google Maps API: Used for embedding maps, geolocation, and places-related features such as grabbing reviews in our application.
- SquareAPI: A powerful API suite for handling payments, inventory, and customer management.
- Instagram Post API: Used for embedding social media feeds or analyzing engagement metrics in our application.

**ERD**
- We use MongoDB which does not necessarily require an ERD. However, the images below are the current schemas of our MongoDB. There are more to come.
